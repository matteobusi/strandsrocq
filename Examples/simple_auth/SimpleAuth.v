  (** * Example: A Simple Unilateral Authentication Protocol

    We consider a simple unilateral authentication protocol based on nonces. The initiator [A] sends a fresh nonce [Na] to the responder [B] who encrypts it together with [A]'s identifier under a symmetric key [SK A B] shared with [A]. The protocol in the Alice/Bob notation follows:
    [[
    A -> B :  A ‚ãÖ B ‚ãÖ Na
    B -> A :  ‚ü® Na ‚ãÖ A ‚ü©_(SK A B)
    ]]
    We use [‚ü® M ‚ü©_k] to note the encryption of [M] under key [k] and [M1 ‚ãÖ M2] to denote the concatenation of [M1] and [M2].
  *)

  (* ============================================================ *)
  (** * Protocol Specification
    Typically honest principals have a single trace quantified over parameters and payload values. In general, however, a principal might execute more than one trace. For example, the penetrator executes different possible traces. Even when we model APIs, we have a single principal/device that implements a variety of functionalities each modeled by a different trace. For this reason, we specify the protocol roles by providing, inductively all the possible traces they can execute.  **)

  (* ============================================================ *)
  (**  ** Protocol Roles **)
  (** The initiator sends a fresh nonce [Na] as output and reads the expected answer [‚ü® Na ‚ãÖ A ‚ü©_(SK A B)] from the responder. Since the type of [Na] is [T], representing atomic terms, we write [$Na] to represent its value as generic term of type [A]. [‚äï] represents an output node, thus the corresponding trace is [[ ‚äï $Na; ‚äñ ‚ü® $Na ‚ãÖ $A ‚ü©_(SK A B) ]].

  (** * Proof of Security
  We now prove unilateral authentication properties of the protocol from the initiator perspective.  *)

  (* ============================================================ *)
  (** ** Non-injective agreement
  The first security property states that the initiator is guaranteed that the responder run the protocol and agreed on parameters [A], [B] and [Na]. Formally:
  [[
    exists s' : Œ£,
      SA_responder_strand A B Na (tr s') /\
      is_strand_of s' C.
  ]]
  The proof revolves around showing that only the responder, with parameters [A], [B] and [Na], can generate the expected ciphertext [‚ü® $Na ‚ãÖ $A ‚ü©_(SK A B)] that we note [c] in the following:
  *)

  (** We now define the set of nodes belonging to bundle C, that have c as subterm.
  First, we define a function [Ncp] from terms to [Prop] that checks if [c ‚äè t] and we prove its decidability.
  Then, we partially instantiate [N], [N_iff_inC_p] and [minimal_N_then_mpt] from MinimalMPT.v in order to respectively define
  - [Nc] : the set of nodes whose term satisfy [Ncp];
  - [Nc_iff_inC_Ncp] : the logical characterization of nodes belonging to [Nc], i.e., [In n (nodes_of C) /\ Ncp (uns_term n)]
  - [minimal_Nc_then_mpt] : a lemma that allows to characterize the minimal of [Nc] as a Prop.
  *)

  Definition Ncp (t : ùî∏) := (‚ü® $Na ‚ãÖ $A ‚ü©_(SK A B)) ‚äè t.
  #[local] Hint Unfold Ncp uns term uns_term : core.

  Lemma Ncp_dec : forall t, { Ncp t } + { ~ Ncp t }.
  Proof.
    intros t;
    destruct (A_subterm_dec (‚ü® $Na ‚ãÖ $A ‚ü©_(SK A B)) t);
    (try now right); (try now left).
  Qed.

  Definition Nc := N Ncp C Ncp_dec.
  Definition Nc_iff_inC_Ncp := N_iff_inC_p Ncp C Ncp_dec.
  Definition minimal_Nc_then_mpt := minimal_N_then_mpt Ncp C_is_bundle Ncp_dec.

  (** We now prove that [Nc] is not empty. This trivially comes from the fact that the term of second node of the initiator strand is indeed equal to [c] *)
  Lemma Nc_non_empty :
    Nc <> nil.
  Proof.
    unfold Nc.
    specialize (s_is_SA_init) as Ht.

    intros Heq; rewrite Heq in Hin.
    destruct Hin; split; try easy.
    autounfold. simplify_term.
  Qed.

  (** We now prove noninjective agreement. The proof is based on lemma [exists_minimal_bundle] stating that each nonempty subset of nodes has a minimal with respect to the [bundle_le] ([‚™Ø]) relation. We apply the lemma to [Nc]. This minimal node is, intuitively, the one that performs the encryption in [c]. We reason by cases and we prove that this minimal node cannot lie neither on a Penetrator nor on an Initiator strand. It lies instead on a Responder strand whose parameters can be proved to be exactly [A], [B] and [Na], as required by the agreement property. Notice, in fact, that [c] contains [A], [Na] in the payload and [B], implicitly, in the key [SK A B]. *)
  Proposition noninjective_agreement :
    exists s' : Œ£,
      SA_responder_strand A B Na s' /\
        is_strand_of s' C.
  Proof.
    specialize (exists_minimal_bundle C_is_bundle Nc_non_empty) as [m [Hin Hmin]].
    assert (Hin':=Hin).
    apply (Nc_iff_inC_Ncp) in Hin' as [HinC HNcp].
    inversion s_is_SA_init as [i Hstrace0].
    specialize (C_is_SA m HinC) as His_SA.
    inversion His_SA as [s' Hpen|A' B' Na' s' Hini|A' B' Na' s' Hres].
    (** _Penetrator case_ *)
    - inversion Hpen as
        [t j Htrace|g j Htrace|g j Htrace|g h j Htrace|g h j Htrace|k Hpenkey j Htrace|
         k h j Htrace|k h j Htrace].

      (** we now use the [minimal_Nc_then_mpt] lemma which provides a characterization of the minimal element of Nc in terms of a Prop covering all the possible cases.

      For example, for the first case, which is the output of an atomic term [t] written [[‚äï $ t]] we obtain the following Prop [False \/ c = $ t /\ True /\ index m = 0], stating that [c = $ t], which is clearly false since [c] is a ciphertext.

      In other cases the [Prop] is more complicate. For example, for pair generation [[‚äñ g; ‚äñ h; ‚äï g ‚ãÖ h]] we obtain
      [[
        ((False \/ subterm c g /\ False /\ index m = 0) \/
        ~ subterm c g /\ subterm c h /\ False /\ index m = 1) \/
        ~ subterm c g /\ ~ subterm c h /\
        (c = g ‚ãÖ h \/ subterm c g \/ subterm c h) /\
        True /\ index m = 2
      ]]
      that is less trivial to analyze by hand. *)

  (** ** Injective agreement
  The second security property additionally states that each responder session correspond to different initiator session, i.e., that authentication is injective and cannot be reused in a replay attack. This property only holds if [Na] is freshly generated which, in the strand spaces model, is captured by the [uniquely_originates] definition. Formally:
  [[
    uniquely_originates $Na ->
    (
      exists s' : Œ£,
        SA_responder_strand A B Na (tr s') /\
        is_strand_of s' C
    )
    /\
    (
      forall s'' : Œ£,
        SA_initiator_strand A B Na (tr s'') ->
        s'' = s
    ).
  ]]
  We first prove injectivity alone, i.e., if [Na] uniquely originates then there's a unique initiator trace agreeing on [Na]. This is somehow trivial and the proofs just applies the definition on [uniquely_originates]:
  *)
  Proposition injectivity :
      uniquely_originates $Na ->
